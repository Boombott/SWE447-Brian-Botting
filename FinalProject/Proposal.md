1. Project Overview <br />
For my final project, I will create a slot machine. It will feature three cubes with multiple images within an object that looks like the case of the machine. The machine will also have a handle that moves and actives the machine when it is pulled. When the handle is pulled, the three cubes will rotate for a short while and stop on one of its sides. If the images on all three of the cubes match, the user wins. 

2. 5 Week Plan
  Week 1: Collect required textures, find cube models or other necessary shapes.
  Week 2: Implement textured cubes, add slot machine handle and case.
  Week 3: Finish coding animation for moving the handle and rotating the cubes.
  Week 4: Make the victory condition detectable; make text to display if player wins or loses.
  Week 5: (Stretch Goal) If not completed, keep track of money; player wins an amount of money depending on what symbols are matched. 

3. I will be using THREE.js to create a web-based application.
